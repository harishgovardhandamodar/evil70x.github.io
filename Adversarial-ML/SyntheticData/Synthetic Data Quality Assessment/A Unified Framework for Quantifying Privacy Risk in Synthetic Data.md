The attacker is given access to the entire generated synthetic dataset and some auxiliary information. 
1. In the attack phase, the framework performs three different attacks (main, naive, and control) each of which outputs guesses on the original private data. 
2. The correctness of these guesses is then evaluated in the evaluation phase against the original training data (main and naive attack) or the control data (control attack). 
3. Based on the evaluation, a final statistical risk quantification is output in the risk estimation phase.
