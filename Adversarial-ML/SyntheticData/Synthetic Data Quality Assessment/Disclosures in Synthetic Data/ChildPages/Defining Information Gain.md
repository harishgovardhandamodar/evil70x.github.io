Now let’s consider the concept of information gain from an identity disclosure. The notion of information gain needs to evaluate how unusual the information is. For example, let’s say that Aiko has four children. Among Asian Americans, only 10% of women ages 40 to 44 have four or more children. On the other hand, Keiko has only two children, which is quite common among Asian American women in the US (50%). Therefore, learning Aiko’s number of children is more informative than Kei‐ ko’s number of children because Aiko’s will stand out within the population of Asian American. In fact, two is the most common number of children among all races in the US, and just guessing that number would have a higher likelihood of getting it right.

An important factor when evaluating meaningful identity disclosure is how usual or common a particular piece of information that we learn about an individual is. Of course, in this analysis we assumed that Aiko’s and Keiko’s number of children were correct in the synthetic data. In practice, these values will be synthesized as well, and therefore if the numbers generated in the synthetic record are not the same as or close to the true values of the real person, then there will be no or limited information gain.
