Jaccard distance between edge sets.  

Compute the Jaccard index between two graphs.

The Jaccard index between two sets provides a measure of similarity between sets. Here, we use the edge sets of two graphs. The index, a measure of similarity, is converted to a distance for consistency with other graph distances.
